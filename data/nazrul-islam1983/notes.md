Values of gmin were calculated from Table 2, as follows:

- Area-based water loss rate was converted to mmol m-2 s-1 (multiply values by 10^4/(18*60)
- VPD estimated to be 0.76 kPa, at 20degC and RH of 67.5% ("65-70%").
- Cuticular component estimated from the ratio 'Cuticular' to 'Stomatal' (two columns on right in table).
- gmin is then Emin / (VPD/100)
