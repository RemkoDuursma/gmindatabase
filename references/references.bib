  Abstract                 = {Winter desiccation is believed to contribute to stress in coniferous trees growing at the treeline because cuticular conductance increases with altitude. To test whether winter desiccation occurs in high-altitude conifers of the Dolomites (NE Italian Alps), we measured minimum cuticular conductance (gmin), needle wettability (contact angle) and cuticle thickness in Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus cembra L. needles from December to August. Samples were collected from adult trees along an altitudinal gradient from valley bottom (1050 m a.s.l.) to the treeline (2170 m a.s.l.). The treeline site is one of the highest in the area and is characterized by a generally low wind exposure. Altitude had no effect on gmin in either species. In P. abies, large seasonal variations in gmin were recorded but no changes were related to needle age class. Pinus cembra had a low gmin and appeared to be efficient in reducing needle water losses. There was a significant increase in gmin with needle aging in P. cembra growing at low altitude that could be related to a shorter needle longevity compared with P. abies. High contact angles ({\textgreater} 110--120$\deg$) suggested the presence of tubular epicuticular waxes on needles of both species. Contact angles were higher (low wettability) in high-altitude needles than in low-altitude needles. By the end of winter, there was no difference in contact angles between needles in the windward and leeward positions. Wax structures transformed toward planar shapes as demonstrated by the decrease in contact angle from winter to summer. In both species, the cuticle was thicker in needles of high-altitude trees than in needles of low-altitude trees and there was no correlation between gmin and cuticle thickness. Because desiccation resistance did not decrease with altitude in either species, we conclude that they are not susceptible to winter desiccation at the tree line.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. Epidermal (non-stomatally-controlled) conductance from the fourth leaf, first node leaf, flag leaf and ear of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var durum L.) grown under Mediterranean field conditions has been measured, along with leaf stomatal frequency and the amount and distribution of epicuticular waxes. Measurements were carried out on varieties and land-races from the Middle East, North Africa, {\textquoteleft}Institut National de la Recherche Agricole{\textquoteright} (INRA) and {\textquoteleft}Centra Internacional de Mejora de Maiz y Trigo{\textquoteright} (CIMMYT). Significant differences were observed among genotypes in the epidermal conductances (ge) of the four organs. For each of the four organs tested, genotypes from the Middle East and CIMMYT showed higher ge. values than those from North Africa and INRA. Ears showed epidermal conductances that were more than four times higher than those of leaves when ge. values were expressed per unit dry weight. The amount of epicuticular waxes was higher in the fourth leaves, intermediate in the first node and flag leaves and lower in the ears. For each organ, ge differences among genotypes were unrelated with the amount of epicuticular waxes. Removal of epicuticular waxes by dipping the organs into chloroform significantly increased the epidermal conductance for the fourth and first node leaves and the ear. However, this did not occur for the flag leaf. For the fourth leaf, ge of intact leaves and ge of leaves in which epicuticular waxes were removed were unrelated (r = -0.265). The regression coefficient of this relation for the first node and flag leaves showed values of 0.666 and 0.650 (P {\textgreater} 0.05), respectively, and values were even higher in the ear (r {\textgreater} m 0.892, P {\textgreater} 0.01). Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that wax bloom decreased from the fourth leaf to the flag leaf, whereas the extent of amorphous wax increased. Wax bloom in leaves consisted mainly of deposits of thin wax plates. In the ears and the adaxial surface of flag leaves, fibrillar waxes predominated. In the first node and flag leaves, the wax deposits on the adaxial side cover the surface of the leaf more densely and uniformly than those on the abaxial side. There was no significant correlation between ge and total stomatal density, or between ge and either adaxial or abaxial stomatal density for any sample of the three different leaves. The contribution of epicuticular waxes plus total stomatal frequency only explained 42.4, 11.8, 28.3 and 16\% of ge (per unit leaf area) variations for the fourth leaf, first node leaf, flag leaf and the combined variation of the three leaves together, respectively. From these results, it is concluded that complex interrelationship between different morphophysiological characteristics probably control ge differences among genotypes and that these interrelationships differ for each different plant part.},

Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (L{\"{o}}sch \& Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant--fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997). In contrast, rhizosphere mutualists such as ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may benefit hosts by increasing surface area for water uptake, enhancing stomatal regulation of water loss, and increasing root hydraulic conductivity (Auge 2001, L{\"{o}}sch \& Gansert 2002).},

Stormogul II, Risto, Sol II, Selma, Sang and Pendek, arranged according to decreasing drought resistance) were cultivated under controlled conditions and exposed to water stress on 4 consecutive days. Seven-day-old seedlings were stressed by cooling the roots for 3 h to 1.0$\deg$C. During this treatment the leaf water potential decreased from -7 to -12 bars. Cuticular transpiration rate, total amount of epicuticular wax and amounts of some wax components (primary alcohols, alkanes, fatty acids) were determined. Unstressed seedlings of the most drought resistant variety (Stormogul II) showed the highest cuticular transpiration rate. After stress treatment the cuticular transpiration rate was most strongly reduced in this variety and at the same time it showed the largest increase in amount of epicuticular wax of the tested varieties. In Pendek and Sang, showing the least increase in epicuticular wax, the cuticular transpiration rate was only 5\% lower after stress treatment. In all varieties the primary alcohol content of the epicuticular wax was slightly higher in stressed seedlings than in controls. Further, in Stormogul and Risto the content of the predominant alkanes was much lower in stressed seedlings than in controls. On the contrary, in Pendek the stressed seedlings showed a higher alkane content. In Stormogul II, Risto and Sol II the total amount of fatty acids was higher in stressed seedlings than in controls while the opposite was true in Sang. The relation between the epicuticular wax (amount and composition) and the cuticular transpiration rate is discussed as well as the possibility of using the tested parameters in a screening test for drought resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanical damage to forests caused by winter ice storms is well known. The January 1998 ice storm in the northeastern United States and adjacent regions of Canada caused major forest damage to the area. Here we report on the physiological effects on four conifers that did not show visible signs of damage after the January 1998 ice storm. Cuticular conductances normally increase during winter. In this winter, they were high immediately after the storm, then fell 17-74\% in the following 30-45 days in hemlock, red pine, and red spruce. We hypothesize that this was caused by the loss of damaged foliage, with high cuticular conductances, over that period. Alternatively, damaged cuticles may have been repaired, although this seems less likely. Relative water contents were higher than normal in some species in the weeks after the storm, due either to an artifact of measurement introduced by the ice that coated needles or to short-term changes in the water-holding capacity of foliage. Water relations of white pine were least affected by this ice storm, whereas hemlock{\textquoteright}s were most affected. These ecophysiological results contrast with the structural effects of ice storms. Red pine is considered to be most sensitive to mechanical injury, while hemlock and red spruce are the least; white pine is intermediate. The order of sensitivity to physiological effects from a major ice storm appears to be hemlock and red spruce, followed by red pine, with white pine the least sensitive. Results from this study suggest that the physiological effects of ice storms can linger long after the ice melts from the canopy.},

Evans, Colorado, USA, were studied during the winters of 1995--1996 and 1996--1997. During both winters, current-year and 1-year-old shoots were collected weekly and their relative water contents (RWC) determined. Measured meteorological parameters were used in a conifer winter water relations model, WINWAT, to simulate changes in shoot RWC of P. engelmannii and A. lasiocarpa during the winter. The model failed to predict shoot RWCs in 1996--1997 when calibrated with 1995--1996 data. The cold early summer of 1995 inhibited xylem formation, which appears to have caused lower rates of water recharge to the needles during the 1995--1996 winter than during the 1996--1997 winter. We conclude that summer climate strongly affects winter water relations in these subalpine species, and that changes in both summer and winter climate must be considered when predicting future ranges of these species.},

  Abstract                 = {Water stress is one of the primary selective forces in plant evolution. There are characters often cited as adaptations to water stress, but links between the function of these traits and adaptation to drying climates are tenuous. Here we combine distributional, climatic, and physiological evidence from 42 species of conifers to show that the evolution of drought resistance follows two distinct pathways, both involving the coordinated evolution of tissues regulating water supply (xylem) and water loss (stomatal pores) in leaves. Only species with very efficient stomatal closure, and hence low minimum rates of water loss, inhabit dry habitats, but species diverged in their apparent mechanism for maintaining closed stomata during drought. An ancestral mechanism found in Pinaceae and Araucariaceae species relies on high levels of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to close stomata during water stress. A second mechanism, found in the majority of Cupressaceae species, uses leaf desiccation rather than high ABA levels to close stomata during sustained water stress. Species in the latter group were characterized by xylem tissues with extreme resistance to embolism but low levels of foliar ABA after 30 d without water. The combination of low levels of ABA under stress with cavitation-resistant xylem enables these species to prolong stomatal opening during drought, potentially extending their photosynthetic activity between rainfall events. Our data demonstrate a surprising simplicity in the way conifers evolved to cope with water shortage, indicating a critical interaction between xylem and stomatal tissues during the process of evolution to dry climates.},

Cuticular permeances were determined by measurement of the water loss through adaxial, astomatous leaf surfaces. Minimum conductances after complete stomatal closure were obtained by leaf drying curves. The comparison of the water permeabilities determined with these two experimental systems revealed good agreement in the case of Acer, Fagus, Quercus, and llex. For Hedera the minimum conductance was 3-fold higher than the cuticular permeance indicating a significant contribution of residual stomatal transpiration. The leaf water potential was measured as a function of water content and analysed by pressure-volume curves. The influence of water potential as a component of the driving force for transpirational water loss was assessed in order to identify modifications of the cuticular barrier by the leaf water content. The ecophysiological meaning of the water relations parameters describing transpiration under drought conditions (cuticular transpiration, minimum transpiration, residual stomatal transpiration, effect of leaf water content on transpiration) and the water relations parameters derived from pressure-volume curves (osmotic potential at full saturation, turgor loss point, bulk modulus of elasticity) are discussed with regard to adaptations for drought resistance.},

The objective of this study was to test three hypotheses: (i) operating stomatal conductance under standard conditions (gop) correlates with minimum stomatal conductance prior to morning light [gmin(dawn)]; (ii) stomatal size (S) is negatively correlated with gop and the maximum rate of stomatal opening in response to light, (dg/dt)max; and (iii) gop correlates negatively with instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUE) despite positive correlations with maximum rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and light-saturated rate of electron transport (Jmax). Using five closely related species of the genus Banksia, the above variables were measured, and it was found that all three hypotheses were supported by the results. Overall, this indicates that leaves built for higher rates of gas exchange have smaller stomata and faster dynamic characteristics. With the aid of a stomatal control model, it is demonstrated that higher gop can potentially expose plants to larger tissue water potential gradients, and that faster stomatal response times can help offset this risk.},

Bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.) is more abundant in mesic gallery forest sites, whereas chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii Englm.) is more abundant in xeric sites. Early, during leaf expansion, gmin was significantly lower in chinquapin oak than in bur oak, though midday water potentials were similar. After leaves had fully expanded, gmin decreased to seasonal minimum values of 4.57 ($\pm$0.274) mmol m-2 s-1 in bur oak, and 2.66 ($\pm$0.156) mmol m-2 s-1 in chinquapin oak. Water potentials at these times were significantly higher in chinquapin oak. As leaves were expanding, photosynthesis (Anet) was significantly higher in chinquapin oak than in bur oak. Later in the growing season, Anet and gleaf increased dramatically in both species, and were significantly higher in bur oak relative to chinquapin oak. We concluded that bur and chinquapin oak have a number of leaf gas exchange characteristics that minimize seasonal water loss. These characteristics are distinct from trees from more mesic sites, and are consistent with the distribution patterns of these trees in tall-grass prairie gallery forests.},

Leaf structural and physiological traits are associated with growth form and habitat, but little is known of the specific traits associated with hemiepiphytes, which are an important component of many tropical forests. Given their life history that includes a drought prone epiphytic stage, hemiepiphytes should be expected to have more drought tolerance-related traits than co-occurring terrestrial species. 2. The genus Ficus includes woody hemiepiphytes distributed in tropical areas throughout the world. Traits related to the flux of water through the leaf and to drought adaptations were studied in five hemiephiphytic (H) and five non-hemiepiphytic (NH) Ficus tree species grown in a common garden to determine genetically based differences. 3. Leaves of H and NH species differed substantially in structure and physiology; on average, H species had smaller leaves with higher leaf mass per unit area, thicker epidermis, smaller vessel lumen diameters in petioles and lower petiole hydraulic conductivity. Leaf traits also indicated stronger drought tolerance in H species, including lower epidermal conductance and turgor loss point and earlier stomatal closure with desiccation than NH species. Across H and NH species, traits related to water flux capacity were negatively correlated with traits related to drought tolerance. 4. The divergences in hydraulics and water relations between growth forms for these closely related species reflected specialization according to contrasting habitat and life form. Conservative water use and increased ability of leaves to persist under severe drought would provide an advantage for H species, especially during the epiphytic phase, while the higher potential water use of NH species would be associated with higher assimilation rates and competitiveness under high water supply. 5. The results indicate a trade-off between leaf water flux capacity and leaf drought tolerance across these hemiephiphytic and non-hemiepiphytic species. Species adaptation to habitats with contrasting demands on leaf function may lead to divergence along a leaf water-flux-droughttolerance spectrum.},

The ratio of the amount of water stored within the stem to the leaf area (kg m-2) increased linearly with plant height. Pressure-volume curves for leaf and stem parenchyma differed markedly; leaves lost turgor at 0.90 relative water content and --3.81 MPa, while the turgor loss point for stem parenchyma occurred at 0--64 relative water content and -0.96 MPa. Specific capacitance (change in relative water content per change in tissue water potential) of stem parenchyma tissue was 84 times higher than that of leaves, while the bulk modulus of elasticity was 346 times lower. Leaf epidermal conductance rates were extremely low (0.32--0.56 mmol m-2 s-1) suggesting that S. palmetto are able to strongly restrict foliar water loss rates. Structurally, stems of S. palmetto appear to be well suited to act as a water storage reservoir, and coupled with the ability to restrict water loss from leaf surfaces, may play an important role in tree survival during periods of low water availability.},

Morpho-anatomical traits, hydraulic conductance and conductivity and water relations in leaves of wind-exposed and protected crown sides were examined during the summer with nearly continuous high winds. Although exposed sides of the crowns were subjected to higher wind speeds and air saturation deficits than the protected sides, leaves throughout the crown had similar minimum leaf water potential (?L). The two species were able to maintain homeostasis in minimum ?L using different physiological mechanisms. Berberis microphylla avoided a decrease in the minimum ?L in the exposed side of the crown by reducing water loss by stomatal control, loss of cell turgor and low epidermal conductance. Colliguaja integerrima increased leaf water transport efficiency to maintain transpiration rates without increasing the driving force for water loss in the wind-exposed crown side. Leaf physiological changes within the crown help to prevent the decrease of minimum ?L and thus contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis, assuring the hydraulic integrity of the plant under unfavorable conditions. The responses of leaf traits that contribute to mechanical resistance (leaf mass per area and thickness) differed from those of large physiological traits by exhibiting low phenotypic plasticity. The results of this study help us to understand the unique properties of shrubs which have different hydraulic architecture compared to trees.},

Traits of interest were (i) epidermal conductance (ge) which influences the rate of water loss from stressed leaves after stomatal closure; (ii) osmotic adjustment (OA) as indicated by tissue osmotic potential (p), which potentially affects the capacity to withdraw water at low soil water potential; and (iii) relative water content (RWC) at incipient leaf death (critical relative water content, RWCC), which is a measure of the dehydration tolerance of leaf tissue. The germplasm comprised a diverse set of 58 soybean genotypes, 2 genotypes of the annual wild species G. soja and 9 genotypes representing 6 perennial wild Glycine spp. indigenous/endemic to Australia. Seedling plants were grown in soil-filled beds in the glasshouse and exposed to terminal water deficit stress from the second trifoliolate leaflet stage (21 days after sowing). Measurements were made on well watered plants, moderately stressed plants, and at incipient plant death, in 2 separate studies. In both studies, there were significant genotypic differences in all 3 traits in the stressed plants. However, across the 3 sample times, ge decreased and the absolute magnitude of p increased, indicating that the expression of these traits changed as the plants acclimated to the stress. RWC was therefore used as a covariate to adjust the genotypic values of p and ge in order to facilitate comparison at a consistent plant water status of 70\% RWC. There was statistically significant genotypic variation for the adjusted values, ge70 and p70, in both studies, and genotypic correlations between the 2 studies were significant (P {\textless} 0.05) and positive for all 3 traits: ge70 (r = 0.48), p70 (r = 0.50), and RWCC (r = 0.53). Among the soybean genotypes, there was at least a 2-fold range in ge70, a 0.7 MPa range in p70, and a 12 percentage point range in RWCC. Some of the perennial wild genotypes exhibited lower values of ge and RWCC and greater OA than soybean and G. soja, consistent with adaptation to drier environments. While the repeatability of measurement between experiments was variable among genotypes, the studies confirmed the existence of genotypic differences for ge, OA, and RWCC in cultivated soybean, with a wider range among the wild germplasm.},

Permeances were in the range 0.6--2.9 $\times$ 10-5 m s-1 and were unaffected by most treatments. In Prunus, P increased slightly but significantly in the NO treatment. In Corylus and Fagus, P was sometimes found to be reduced by fumigation with NO, but not always. Betula leaves grown under elevated SO2 and NO2 showed higher values of P only if they were visibly damaged. Minimum conductances (gmin) estimated from water loss rates of both sides of detached hypo stomatous leaves were higher than P, and were more strongly affected by treatments. In these cases, the most probable explanation is some damage to stomatal function resulting in a reduced ability to close after leaf excision. Effects of growing conditions and time of year on P were found, which allowed a hypothetical interaction between P and stomatal sensitivity to air humidity to be tested in beech. No unambiguous indication of such a relationship was found.},

The ability of a plant to survive severe water deficits depends on its ability to restrict water loss through the leaf epidermis after stomata attain minimum aperture. At this stage, the rate of water loss is regulated by the epidermal conductance (gc). Low gc would be a useful selection criterion to identify genotypes with enhanced survival capability. Consequently, variation in gc among Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genotypes was evaluated. Since there is little conclusive evidence linking gc with leaf waxiness, alternative hypotheses relating gc to stomatal trails were also examined. Epidermal conductance varied from 6.3 to 17.6mmol m-2 s-1 among sorghum genotypes. It was unrelated to stomatal pore length which varied with genotype and to pore depth which was similar for all genotypes measured. However, gc, increased with increasing stomatal density. This indicates that stomatal density plays a direct role in water loss even at very low conductances. The association of low stomatal density with low gc is consistent with the hypothesis that at the smallest stomata aperture, water loss from the epidermis above guard cell teichodes becomes a significant source of leaf water loss. Since low gc is directly related to crop survival under severe water deficits, it is recommended that genotypes with low gc. be selected using the selection criterion of stomatal density.},

  Abstract                 = {Hawaiian endemic tree Acacia koa is a model for heteroblasty with bipinnately compound leaves and phyllodes. Previous studies suggested three hypotheses for their functional differentiation: an advantage of leaves for early growth or shade tolerance, and an advantage of phyllodes for drought tolerance. We tested the ability of these hypotheses to explain differences between leaf types for potted plants in 104 physiological and morphological traits, including gas exchange, structure and composition, hydraulic conductance, and responses to varying light, intercellular CO2, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and drought. Leaf types were similar in numerous traits including stomatal pore area per leaf area, leaf area-based gas exchange rates and cuticular conductance. Each hypothesis was directly supported by key differences in function. Leaves had higher mass-based gas exchange rates, while the water storage tissue in phyllodes contributed to greater capacitance per area; phyllodes also showed stronger stomatal closure at high VPD, and higher maximum hydraulic conductance per area, with stronger decline during desiccation and recovery with rehydration. While no single hypothesis completely explained the differences between leaf types, together the three hypotheses explained 91\% of differences. These findings indicate that the heteroblasty confers multiple benefits, realized across different developmental stages and environmental contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {To identify environmental and biological drivers of nocturnal vapour exchange, we quantified intra-annual, intra- and inter-specific variation in nocturnal water transport among ecologically diverse Eucalyptus species. We measured sap flux (Js) and leaf physiology (leaf surface conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and water potential (\{Psi\}l)) in three to five trees of eight species. Over 1 year, nocturnal Js (Js,n) contributed 5-7\% of total Js in the eight species. The principal environmental driver of Js,n was the product of atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (D) and wind speed (U). Selected observations suggest that trees with higher proportions of young foliage may exhibit greater Js,n and nocturnal gs (gs,n). Compared with other tree taxa, nocturnal water use in Eucalyptus was relatively low and more variable within than between species, suggesting that (i) Eucalyptus as a group exerts strong nocturnal stomatal control over water loss and (ii) prediction of nocturnal flux in Eucalyptus may depend on simultaneous knowledge of intra-specific tree traits and nocturnal atmospheric conditions.},

The pattern and amount of night transpiration was changed by current vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but not by VPD or transpiration during the previous day. Mean night transpiration per unit VPD was unchanged by current VPD. Night transpiration of whole plants increased linearly with VPD though genotypes differed significantly in amount. The most profligate genotype transpired at 50 g m-2 leaf h-1 at a VPD of 30 mbar which was twice the rate of the most thrifty genotype. Attempts were made to estimate the proportion of night transpiration occurring through the stomata and the cuticle by three methods: comparisons of stressed and unstressed leaves, wilting patterns of detached leaves, and transpiration rates of detached leaves in ABA solutions. The methods gave equivalent rankings of the genotypes and similar absolute values for the 'cuticular component', which contributed 13-50\% of total night transpiration. We conclude that transpiration could exceed 0.5 mm per night in unstressed crops, though this would be considerably reduced by selection of genotypes with both low cuticular and low stomatal transpiration.},

Klamina was also co-ordinated with lamina thickness, water storage capacitance, 1/mesophyll water transfer resistance, and, in five of the six species, with lamina perimeter/area. However, for the six species, Klamina was independent of inter-related leaf traits including leaf dry mass per area, density, modulus of elasticity, osmotic potential, and cuticular conductance. Klamina was thus co-ordinated with structural and functional traits relating to liquid-phase water transport and to maximum rates of gas exchange, but independent of other traits relating to drought tolerance and to aspects of carbon economy.},

  Abstract                 = {Across plant species, leaves vary enormously in their size and their venation architecture, of which one major function is to replace water lost to transpiration. The leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) represents the capacity of the transport system to deliver water, allowing stomata to remain open for photosynthesis. Previous studies showed that Kleaf relates to vein density (vein length per area). Additionally, venation architecture determines the sensitivity of Kleaf to damage; severing the midrib caused Kleaf and gas exchange to decline, with lesser impacts in leaves with higher major vein density that provided more numerous water flow pathways around the damaged vein. Because xylem embolism during dehydration also reduces Kleaf, we hypothesized that higher major vein density would also reduce hydraulic vulnerability. Smaller leaves, which generally have higher major vein density, would thus have lower hydraulic vulnerability. Tests using simulations with a spatially explicit model confirmed that smaller leaves with higher major vein density were more tolerant of major vein embolism. Additionally, for 10 species ranging strongly in drought tolerance, hydraulic vulnerability, determined as the leaf water potential at 50\% and 80\% loss of Kleaf, was lower with greater major vein density and smaller leaf size ({\textbar}r{\textbar} = 0.85--0.90; P {\textless} 0.01). These relationships were independent of other aspects of physiological and morphological drought tolerance. These findings point to a new functional role of venation architecture and small leaf size in drought tolerance, potentially contributing to well-known biogeographic trends in leaf size.},

The response of the plants was analysed for three distinct stages of dehydration. In stage I, the rate of transpiration remained constant and equal to that of well watered plants even though soil water status fell by more than 50\%. Stage II began when the rate of soil water supply to the plant was less than potential transpiration and stomates closed resultingjn the maintenance of plant water balance. When soil water content was expressed as a fraction of transpirable soil water, all species showed a transition from stage I to stage II at a fraction of transpirable soil water of about 0.3 to 0.2. As the soil water declined further, all species had a similar decrease in relative transpiration rate. Consequently, the responses of the four species in stages I and II were essentially identical, except that pigeonpea extracted a slightly greater amount of soil water. Stage III occurred once stomates had reached minimum conductance and water loss was then a function of the epidermal conductance and the environment around the leaf. Substantial differences were found among the four grain legumes in epidermal conductance. Soybean had the highest conductance, followed by black gram, cowpea and pigeonpea. Substantial variation in dehydration tolerance among the four grain legumes was also found: the ranking of dehydration tolerance based on the relative water content was pigeonpea {\textgreater} cowpea {\textgreater} mungbean {\textgreater} soybean. Differences among the four grain legume species in the duration of stage III which finished when plants died, were consistent with differences in epidermal conductance and in dehydration tolerance of leaves.},

Low gmin may affect survival of perennial grasses by maintaining tissue hydration during drought. If true, populations from environments where drought is severe may exhibit reduced gmin compared to those from less arid environments. Success of invasive grasses may also be associated with reduced gmin compared to non-invasive competitors. Using plants grown in a single environment, we measured gmin of leaves from populations of Digitaria californica from environments with similar annual precipitation but differing in average drought severity (southern Arizona and western Texas, USA), and a population of the exotic species Eragrostis lehmanniana that has invaded sites occupied by D. californica in Arizona. Epidermal conductance was lower in the D. californica population from the more arid environment (Texas). Likewise, gmin was lower in E. lehmanniana than in the Arizona D. californica population. Shoot biomass production as a fraction of gmin was higher in E. lehmanniana than in the D. californica populations and was higher in the Texas D. californica population than in the Arizona population. This suggests that low gmin may be a component of drought avoidance in these grasses.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Arid and semiarid ecosystems in the Mediterranean are under high risk of desertification. Revegetation with native well-adapted evergreen shrubs is desirable, but techniques for successful establishment of these species are not fully developed. Transplant shock is a key hurdle to plantation success. The application of a drought-preconditioning treatment during the last months of nursery culture is a potential technique for reducing transplant shock. This technique has been widely applied in boreal habitats and humid temperate areas. Three representative Mediterranean species (Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus coccifera, and Juniperus oxycedrus seedlings) were exposed to classic drought-preconditioning treatment consisting of reductions in the watering regime. The effects of preconditioning on seedling quality were assessed by cell water relationships (pressure--volume curves), minimal transpiration, leaf capacitance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and gas exchange. Moreover, seedlings were exposed to transplant shock (intense drought period) during which water potential (predawn and midday) and maximal photochemical efficiency were evaluated to establish seedling performance. Results showed that preconditioning did not affect cell water relationships and minimal transpiration in any of the three species. Preconditioned seedlings of P. lentiscus maintained higher water content during desiccating conditions as a consequence of an increase in leaf water content at full turgor. These changes allowed plants to maintain higher net CO2 assimilation rates and an elevated photosystem II status, facilitating an increase in drought survival. Preconditioning improved the performance of Q. coccifera and J. oxycedrus seedlings, but these two species were much less responsive than P. lentiscus seedlings. Finally, results suggest that sensitivity to drought preconditioning may be related to drought tolerance or avoidance strategy of each species. Drought-related strategies should be considered to optimize management scale preconditioning.},

Five Eucalyptus and two Acacia species from semi-arid to mesic habitats were subjected to a 2 month water stress treatment (?pre-dawn{~}={~}-1.7 to -2.3{~}MPa). Carbohydrates dominated the leaf metabolite profiles of species from dry areas, whereas organic acids dominated the metabolite profiles of species from wet areas. Water stress caused large decreases in photosynthesis and Cc, increases in 17--33 metabolites and decreases in 0--9 metabolites. In most species, fructose, glucose and sucrose made major contributions to osmotic adjustment. In Acacia, significant osmotic adjustment was also caused by increases in pinitol, pipecolic acid and trans-4-hydroxypipecolic acid. There were also increases in low-abundance metabolites (e.g. proline and erythritol), and metabolites that are indicative of stress-induced changes in metabolism [e.g. ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt, photorespiration, phenylpropanoid pathway]. The response of gas exchange to water stress and rewatering is rather consistent among species originating from mesic to semi-arid habitats, and the general response of metabolites to water stress is rather similar, although the specific metabolites involved may vary.},
